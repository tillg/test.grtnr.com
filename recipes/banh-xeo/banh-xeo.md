excerpt: One of our favourite dishes in Vietnam
---

One of our favourite dishes in Vietnam is Banh Xeo. Of course there is no way you can make a real, Vietnamese Banh Xeo outside of Vietnam. nevertheless, even the shallow fake Banh Xeos help us to feel warm and remember Vietnam.

This recipe is from our friends Hanna & Dennis - and we will have a Corona-Remote-Banh-Xeo-Dinner with them tomorrow... ?
