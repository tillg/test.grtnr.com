**Ingrediences** for 5 people
•	3 kg of kliška. That’s beef used for Guláš. In English it’s shin, in German Schienbein.
•	2-3 kg onions
•	Paprika powder – red, not too hot. A glas full!
•	Paprika powder red, hot. Less.
•	Oil (not olive oil). Even better would be Schmalz
•	Mayoran
•	4-5 chilis
•	Knedliky

**Preparation**
•	Peel the onions and cut them in little pieces.
•	Put the onions a big pot, add some oil. Now let the onions boil and stir them from time to time until they are slightly brownish.
•	Meanwhile clean the meet: Cut out the greasy parts and the muscle fibers. Don’t be afraid to cut out a lot! It is normal that over ½ kg is cut away! Cut the meet in pieces of about 3 cm size.
•	Once the onions are brown add the meet.
•	Let the whole thing cook at least 3 hours. Eventually add some water if it gets too dry.
•	Add paprika powder, salt, pepper, mayoran, the chilis – and let it cook another couple of hours.
•	Serve with slices of steamed knedliky

**March 06, Till** Did it together with Stepan.
Problems I had:
•	When the gulas became dry it started burning / becoming black.
•	It had the tendency of being rather dry. How can we make it saucier?
