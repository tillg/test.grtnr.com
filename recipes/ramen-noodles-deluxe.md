From Spartacus' series of fast recipes for non-skilled cooks.

- Boil an egg hard (or buy hard boiled eggs)
- Boil water (for the ramen)
- Cut three slices of regular boiled sandwich ham in stripes
- Open a small can of green peas
- Put the ramen noodles in a bowl with the seasoning and broth powder
- Add chili powder and curry powder if you like it hotter
- Pour boiling water on the ramen so they are covered
- Put the ham stripes and peas in on top
- Mix it all up
- Cut your egg in half
- When three minutes have passed since you poured the water on the noodles, place the egg halves in the soup

Carry your plate to a cozy corner and eat (chopsticks are more fun for this, and slurping the soup straight out of the bowl tastes better)
Cooking time: 8 minutes
