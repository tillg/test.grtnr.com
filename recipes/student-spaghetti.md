From Spartacus' series of fast recipes for non-skilled cooks.

- Boil a portion of spaghetti in salted water two minutes less than it says on the package.
- Optional: while the spaghetti is boiling fry two bratwursts (the thinner kind).
- When the spaghetti is boiled, pour off the water.
- Put the spaghetti back in the pot.
- Take as cup of Creme fraiche (two small packages or one medium package) and stir it down into the spaghetti with the stove on. Let the cr√®me fraiche melt, but not start to thicken.
- Add a fist full or more of grated Parmesan - the ready grated kind is the easiest - and stir that into the pasta while still on the stove.
Ground some black pepper in, stir one last time.
- Put it on a plate - add the optional sausages if you decided for those.

Takes 12, 15 minutes max to make - no cooking skills required and tastes delicious.
