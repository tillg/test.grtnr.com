From Spartacus' series of fast recipes for non-skilled cooks.

- Open a can of tuna and pour off the oil or water
- Put the tuna in s bowl
- Stir down a bunch of mayonnaise (not too much or it gets runny)
- Season with salt, pepper, chili, and curry powder until it tastes good
- Toast a few slices of white toast bread (French baguette is even better if you can get it)
- Eat it by taking the melt out of the pot with a fork or knife, tear or cut bitesized pieces of bread and just put a generous dab of melt on

Cooking time: 3-4 minutes, no heating required if you have baguette.
